Hi, I'm Pietro Sillano, a **Physics student**  in my second year in Msc. Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Turin.
My main interest of research is **BioPhysics** and how we can represent many natural phenomena using physics methods and frameworks like Statistical Physics and or Statistical Inference.
Since last year, I got interested in **ML & AI** and I joined the  <a href="https://www.mljc.it/"> <b>Machine Learning Journal Club  </b> </a>, a non-profit research organization from Turin focused on interdisciplinary applications of Machine and Deep Learning.

 
<!--
### Experiences

In summer 2021 I did an Internship at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun (Poland) about applied machine learning and network theory.
We also collaborate with History department working on some Natural Language Processing on ancient Latin texts.-->

<!--When I have free time I work on some personal project about techIf you're interested check out my blog posts and my github pages!-->


<h2> Why SullivanStuff? </h2> 
There was an inside joke between me and my roommates and we choose three pseudonyms: “Sullivan” reminds my surname (that's what they said ). While “stuff” well... I have many interests and I really like to experiment and learn new things, and this is my attempt to write about them (hoping to improve my writing skills as well).
I will talk mainly about my experience as a physics student and as an ML & tech passionate. While in the future I want to start writing about books, food science and who knows!
See you there!
