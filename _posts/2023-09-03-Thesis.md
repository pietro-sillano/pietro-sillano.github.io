Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share what I have done for my Master's thesis. In my thesis, I delved deep into the world of polymer models and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, trying to shed light on the intriguing behavior of nuclear chromatin.

## About My Thesis

**Title:** *Understanding Nuclear Chromatin Dynamics Through Polymer Models and MD Simulations*

In this thesis, I explored different polymer models and MD simulations can help us decipher the complex dynamics of nuclear chromatin, the material that makes up the nucleus of our cells. It's a fascinating journey into the microscopic world, where I tried to unravel the mysteries of how chromatin behaves and how it impacts various biological processes.
