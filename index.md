<!-- # About me-->

Hello! 

I am Pietro and I work as a PhD student at TUDelft, under the supervision of [Timon Idema](https://idemalab.tudelft.nl/idema.html) and [Siewert J. Marrink](https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.j.marrink/). My research interests lie at the interface between biology, soft matter and computational physics. I'm especially interested in how biological and artificial cells can divide themselves. 

## Where I've Been
In April 2023 I graduated in Msc. Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Turin. I completed my Msc thesis under the supervision of [Angelo Rosa](https://sites.google.com/site/angelosissa/home) at SISSA in Trieste. The focus of my thesis was on polymer models and MD simulations of nuclear chromatin. It was fascinating and deepened my interest in this field.


## Beyond Physics
I am also an active member of the non-profit research organization - Machine Learning Journal Club, located mainly in Turin, Italy. Our organization works on various projects related to machine learning and publishes research articles on our [website](https://www.mljc.it/).
