<!-- # About me-->

Hello! 

I will be a PhD student at TUDelft, under the supervision of [Timon Idema](https://idemalab.tudelft.nl/idema.html) and [Siewert J. Marrink](https://www.rug.nl/staff/s.j.marrink/) in the field of research that has always fascinated me - BioPhysics and Computational Physics. My project is part of the [BaSyC](https://www.basyc.nl/) consortium. 


Prior to this, I completed my MSc thesis under the supervision of [Angelo Rosa](https://sites.google.com/site/angelosissa/home) at SISSA in Trieste. The focus of my thesis was on polymer models and MD simulations of nuclear chromatin, which further solidified my interest in the field.


In April 2023 I graduated in Msc. Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Turin.
My main interest of research is **BioPhysics** and **Statistical Physics**.



I am also an active member of the non-profit research organization - Machine Learning Journal Club, located mainly in Turin, Italy. Our organization works on various projects related to machine learning and publishes research articles on our [website](https://www.mljc.it/).
