<!--# About me-->
I'm currently a **Physics student**  in my second year in Msc. Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Turin.
My main interest of research is **BioPhysics** and **Statistical Physics**.

I'm also a member of a Machine Learning student association: check out our works on **_[MLJC](https://www.mljc.it/)_**.

*As a problem-solving enthusiast, I have always been eager to meet new technical challenges, where I can learn some new things and feed my curiosity.  
As an Physics student, I love to put forward my technical and analytical skills, tackle original problems and learn every day.*
