<!--# About me-->
I'm currently a **Physics student**  in my second year in Msc. Physics of Complex Systems at the University of Turin.
My main interest of research is **BioPhysics** and **Statistical Physics**.

From October I am working on my Msc Thesis with **Angelo Rosa** at [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/sbp/research/research.php) in Trieste. The topic is polymer models and MD simulations of chromatin.

I'm also a member of a non-profit research organization: the Machine Learning Journal Club! We are located mainly in Turin, Italy. Check out our works and active projects on our [Website](https://www.mljc.it/).
