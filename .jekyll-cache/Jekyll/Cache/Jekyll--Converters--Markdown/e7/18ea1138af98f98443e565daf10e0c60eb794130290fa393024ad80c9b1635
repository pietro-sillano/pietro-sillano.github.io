I"¦<p>This project has been developed during the 2021 hackathon organized by G-Tec. In these two days, we analyzed a motor imagery Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) dataset from chronic stroke patients. In recent years, BCIs have been widely used as rehabilitation tools to help the recovery process.. Thanks to BCIs, we can detect brain signals, and use them to  recognize the willingness of the subject to move a part of their body, like . In fact, before performing a movement, we rehearse it in our minds and we activate a specific brain area .This process is called motor imagery (MI), and the resulting brain signal can be recorded and interpreted to  enhance  a therapy.</p>
